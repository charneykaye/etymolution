***n.*** A new word, wherein: An existing word&#8217;s [fixes](/fix), pre- and suf-, have been deconstructed and individually considered for their addition of essential meaning versus their burden on the reader&#8217;s lucidity.

New alternative fixes are considered for their value added, and the reassembled root, fixes and alternative fixes are proposed to more effectively communicate the essential meaning of the original word.

also ***v.*** To study a word and create a refix of it.
