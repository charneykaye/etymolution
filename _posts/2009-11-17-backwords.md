***n.*** Words written, spelled, spoken, or sung in reverse.

Can refer to reverse sentences:

> Sentences reverse to refer can.

Or reversed words in a [forword](/forword/) sentence:

> Desrever sdrow ni a drowrof ecnetnes.

Or entirely reversed words and sentences:

> Secnetnes dna sdrow desrever yleritne.

Can also, in certain circumstances, refer to letters themselves being reversed (i.e. mirrored), but this should not be attempted by beginners.

also ***adj.*** as ***Backword*** and ***adv.*** as ***Backwords***. *Colloquial.*

Used to describe written or spoken language that either reneges on a previous statement or seeks to change previous words retroactively.
