***n.*** The creator of a product whose success remains within his or her immediate friends and family members, thus abandoning profit in favor of local gratification.

> The release party of Greg&#8217;s debut feature film was attended by only the 3 best friends he made it with, and their friends and families. Not wanting to be a self-consumer, Greg failed to attend.
