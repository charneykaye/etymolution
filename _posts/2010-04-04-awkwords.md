**n.** Words chosen deliberately to make the listener feel awkward, in order to propagate discomfort, alarm, shock, or hilarity.

> Her awkwords about her dead mother prompted him to make excuses and leave the bar, thereby saving her the trouble of giving him a telephony number.

also ***Awkword*, adj.** The feeling one gets immediately after voicing a statement or question with inadvertent sexual connotations.

> Sally got overexcited about the candy selection at the store and shouted, “I want that big hard one in my mouth, like, *right now*!”  The store got quiet and everyone looked at her; suddenly she realized what she’d said and felt extremely awkword.

also ***Awkwordy,* adj.** Having a tendency to use obscure words with many syllables, but using them to excess and often inaccurately.

> He posed as intelligent, but he was so awkwordy it was clear he had no idea what he was talking about and was just trying to impress her.
