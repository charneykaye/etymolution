***n.*** A large quantity of emotion aroused by the recall of a memory; the sudden internal emotional flooding caused by past or present incident.

> An instance of *deja vu* recalled old trauma, unleashing an invalanche of horrible flashbacks.

also ***n.*** Anything collapsing suddenly unstoppably inward.

> The cannon blasted and the circus tent invalanched, shocking the audience only briefly before crushing them.
